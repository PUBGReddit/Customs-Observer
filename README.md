# PUBG Custom Team Logos Setup Guide

PUBG allows any player to add custom Team Logos to their games using what is called the `Observer File`.   
This will add the logo to the corresponding teams in the KillFeed.  

If you are an Observer while spectating Esport/Custom games, you will also see the team names and tags.

# Observer Folder
The Observer folder is a folder container the logos and configurations which the game understands and loads.  
For PUBG to load everything correctly, the observer folder MUST be place in the correct location before starting the game.   
You can follow the How-To guide to learn on how to download and configure your own game to use the PUBG Reddit's custom teams.
